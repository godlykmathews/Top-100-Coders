#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala should bring upon more Schemes to develope a startup from scratch.
- The Govt can provide little funds to kick start student Startup, only after validating there idea.
- The YIP is active but they only select 1 or 2 ideas. They should validate many ideas, go through all the ideas and tell the students the potentials problems in there idea. They shouldn't reject and ditch the students idea this could only discourage bright minds.
